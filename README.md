# PortfolioPlanner
 
My first project on GitHub!

Portfolio Planner is Dash App for creating projections of custom portfolios with illustrative charts and info spreadsheet.
It uses Capital Asset Pricing Model, yahoo finance API and log-normal distribution to make it's projections and gives 
user the freedom of choice for confidence level and projection length.

I started learning python in the summer of 2020 on my own, so there is some "creative" solutions and workarounds, but it works as intended.
I will continue cleaning the app and I am open for constructive feedback with tips to improve.

Repository is currently a mess, but will improve as I learn more about GitHub
